# Climate-Learning

## Data Analysis

This repository includes various routines used to Analyze various climate models which a priori include
- Plasim (Intermediate complexity)
- CESM (High complexity)
- ERA Reanalysis (observational)
The functions and classes we define can be used for estimation of heat wave occurances 

## Machine Learning
We use neural networks to compute committor functions


## Rare event algorithm
